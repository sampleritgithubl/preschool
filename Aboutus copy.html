                Playschool helps in building a strong foundation in social, pre-academics, and general 
                life skills. It helps in the development of a child's emotional and personal growth and provides
                opportunities for children to learn in ways that sheerly interests them and develop a strong sense
                of curiosity. Consequently, it helps in building a positive association with inquisitive learning 
                in the form of fun activities and guided play. Playschool is important for your child as it helps 
                in making the child habitual of the routine. The child also becomes aware of himself/herself and 
                develops motor and cognitive skills. Playschools further enable the child to receive individual
                attention as the school has a very low student-to-teacher ratio. According to the report, only
                48% of poor children who were born in 2001 "started school ready to learn, compared to 75% of
                children from middle- income families." Additionally, the amount of time parents of various 
                socioeconomic statuses spend reading to their children has changed since the 1960s and 1970s.
                 Parents with higher education read to their kids for up to an additional 30 minutes per day 
                between 2010 and 2012, which adds up by the time the kids enter kindergarten. The kids are given 
                the 'right' toys to play with according to their age of development which helps them to develop and
                 learn the things that can be implemented or transferred onto them, 
                such as changing the clothes of the doll, feeding the doll, etc. Some more benefits 
                of playschool are mentioned below
